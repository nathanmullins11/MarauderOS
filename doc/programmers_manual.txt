Function
    char* itoa(int value, char* destination, int base) 
Description
    converts an integer to a string value with a specified base (ie. binary, hex, decimal, etc.) Function takes in an integer of base 10, an array to store the converted integer, and a numerical base used to represent the value as a string. Returns the converted string into the destination array. 
Parameters: 
    int value - integer to convert to string. Integers must be non-negative and not exceed ((2^31)-1), since an int is 4 bytes, or 32 bits. 

    char* destination - array to store string. Size of destination must not exceed 50 bytes of storage. 

    int base - numerical base used to represent the value as a string. Base must be between and including 2-36 (after 36, the number of unique symbols required to represent the digits exceeds the number of standard alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z) available)
