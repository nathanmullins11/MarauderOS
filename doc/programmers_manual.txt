Programmers Manual

Function
    char* itoa(int value, char* destination, int base) 
Description
    converts an integer to a string value with a specified base (ie. binary, hex, decimal, etc.) Function takes in an integer of base 10, an array to 
    store the converted integer, and a numerical base used to represent the value as a string. Returns the converted string into the destination array. 
Parameters: 
    int value - integer to convert to string. Integers must be non-negative and not exceed ((2^31)-1), since an int is 4 bytes, or 32 bits. 

    char* destination - array to store string. Size of destination must not exceed 50 bytes of storage. 

    int base - numerical base used to represent the value as a string. Base must be between and including 2-36 (after 36, the number of unique symbols 
    required to represent the digits exceeds the number of standard alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z) available)


Function
    void version(void) 
Description
    prints the most updated/current version of the MarauderOS along with the last compilation date. Function is called by the user in the terminal by 
    typing “version” when running MarauderOS. 
Parameters
    version() takes no parameters and does not return anything. 


Function
    void clear_input_buffer(device dev) 
Description
    clears the specified device of characters to flush unwanted/extra output characters, ideally before writing then reading output to the device. 
    Does not return anything. 
Parameters: 
    device dev - a communication port for serial communication limited to predefined devices COM1, CMO2, COM3, COM4, which represent addresses for 
    serial communication ports. 


Function
    int serial_poll(device dev, char *buffer, size_t len) 
Description
    polls a device dev for data and will store it in an array one character at a time until a new line (enter key) is encountered or the buffer is 
    full. Returns the number of bytes read from dev, or a negative number if an error has occurred.
Parameters:
    device dev - a communication port for serial communication limited to predefined devices COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, which represent addresses for 
    serial communication ports. 

    char* buffer - user provided buffer that stores chars being polled from dev. Size is predefined. 

    size_t len - length of buffer, allowable amount of characters to enter buffer without overflow. 


Function
    void help(const char* cmd)
Description
    Provides usage instructions/ description for all available commands given to the user. Does not return anything.
Parameters
    const char* cmd - Optional parameter cmd that provides specific instruction/description about the parameter if it is a command that exists. 
    Parameter cmd must be of length smaller than the defined buffer size.
